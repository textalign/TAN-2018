    ## Very few work-versions have their own URN names. It is advisable to assign a tag URN or a UUID. If you have used an IRI for <work> that you are entitled to modify, you may wish to add a suffix that will name the version. If you need to specify exactly where on a text-bearing object a version appears, <desc> or <comment> should be used.
