element-normalization =
    
    ## specifies an alteration that has been made to a source file to bring the transcription into conformity with standards or common expectations. This element is used typically for minor corrections, e.g., suppression of discretionary hyphenation. You should declare every normalizing change you have made to the source.
    
    ## <normalization> is especially helpful in reference to nondigital sources, but it may be made also for digital sources, to declare global changes that would be cumbersome, difficult, or impossible to describe via regular expressions in <replace>. 
    
    ## The sequence of consecutive <normalization> is immaterial.

    ## The conventions of this element and its children parallel the XPath function replace(). See http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-replace
    
    ## The sequence of consecutive <replace>s is important, reflecting the order in which replacements occured. Results may differ depending upon the order of replace operations.

element-version =
    
    ## identifies the version of a work. Applicable to sources that contain multiple versions, e.g., original text and facing translations. Like <work>, <version> points to a conceptual entity, not a physical one.
    
    ## In the context of a class 1 file, the entity identified by <version> is assumed to be a version of the entity defined in <work>.  
    
    ## Very few work-versions have their own URN names. It is advisable to assign a tag URN or a UUID. If you have used an IRI for <work> that you are entitled to modify, you may wish to add a suffix that will name the version. If you need to specify exactly where on a text-bearing object a version appears, <desc> or <comment> should be used.
    
    ## For more, see main.xml#conceptual_works
    element version { entity-nondigital-no-id }
element-work =
    
    ## identifies a creative textual work, understood conceptually, not physically (e.g., Homer's Iliad, not a particular version or copy of it).
    
    ## The term "work" is only loosely defined in TAN. Any text that has enough unity to be referred to in ordinary conversation as a single entity may be identified as a work. A work may be composed of other works, be a part of other works, or even overlap with other works. E.g., the Lord's Prayer, the Gospel of Luke, the Tetravengelion, the New Testament, and the Bible are all valid works, despite the complex relationship between each of them.

link-element-model =
    
    ## identifies a class-1 file has been used as a model for how the current file has been segmented and labeled.
