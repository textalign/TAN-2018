    ## Very few work-versions have their own URN names. It is advisable to assign a tag URN or a UUID. If you have used an IRI for <work> that you are entitled to modify, you may wish to add a suffix that will name the version.

A work may be composed of other works, be a part of other works, or even overlap with other works. E.g., the Lord's Prayer, the Gospel of Luke, the Tetravengelion, the New Testament, and the Bible are all valid works, despite the complex relationship between each of them.
