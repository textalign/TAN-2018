               the form of a meta-edition – reproductions of relevant editions that have been
               published: From the editio princeps, that is the first ever printed version of the
               Confessio – edited by Sir James Ware in 1656 and based on the Irish and British
               manuscript copies only – up to the canonical version of the critical text established
               in the scholarly edition by Ludwig Bieler in 1950.</p>

            <p part="N">The Saint Patrick’s Confessio Hypertext Stack Project is funded under the Irish
               government Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions (PRTLI), Cycle 4. It is
               part of the Humanities Serving Irish Society (HSIS) initiative, a partnership of
               equals committed to developing an inter-institutional research infrastructure for the
               humanities. The Hyperstack is one of two projects running at Royal Irish Academy
               under the label ADR, "Academy Digital Resources", supported by the Digital Humanities
               Observatory (DHO). (The second ADR project being the Doegen Project building up a
               digital archive of Irish dialect recordings).</p>
            <p part="N">The Hyperstack Project was conceived and is overseen by Dr Anthony Harvey, editor of
               the Royal Irish Academy Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources. Since
               September 2008 Dr Franz Fischer has been the postdoctoral researcher in charge. A
               series of collaborators facilitate the project and greatly enhance its value. Not
               least there is a postgrad intern for three months each summer.</p>
            <p part="N">The St Patrick’s Confessio Hypertext Stack Project aims to give Irish society as
               direct access as possible to the historical Patrick. In order to achieve this the
               project aims to build up a comprehensive digital research environment to make
               accessible to academic specialists, as well as to interested lay people, all the
               textual aspects of the real St Patrick’s own work.</p>

            <div type="para" n="1" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">My name is Patrick. I am a sinner, a simple country person, and the least of all
               believers. I am looked down upon by many.</p></div>
            <div type="para" n="2" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">My father was Calpornius. He was a deacon; his father was Potitus, a priest, who
               lived at Bannavem Taburniae. His home
               was near there, and that is where I was taken prisoner. I was about sixteen at the
               time.</p></div>
            <div type="para" n="3" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">At that time, I did not know the true God. I was taken into captivity in Ireland,
               along with thousands of others. We deserved this, because we had gone away from God,
               and did not keep his commandments. We would not listen to our priests, who advised us
               about how we could be saved. The Lord brought his strong anger upon us, and scattered us
               among many nations even to the ends of the earth. It was among foreigners that it was
               seen how little I was. </p></div>
         </div>

            <div type="para" n="1" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">It was there that the Lord opened up my awareness of my lack of faith. Even though it
               came about late, I recognised my failings. So I turned with all my heart to the Lord
               my God, and he looked down on my lowliness and had mercy on my youthful ignorance. He
               guarded me before I knew him, and before I came to wisdom and could distinguish
               between good and evil. He protected me and consoled me as a father does for his
               son.</p></div>

               blessings and such a gift that the Lord so kindly bestowed in the land of my
               captivity. This is how we can repay such blessings, when our lives change and we come
               to know God, to praise and bear witness to his great wonders before every nation
               under heaven.</p></div>

            <div type="para" n="1" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">This is because there is no other God, nor will there ever be, nor was there ever,
               except God the Father. He is the one who was not begotten, the one without a
               beginning, the one from whom all beginnings come, the one who holds all things in
               being – this is our teaching.</p></div>
            <div type="para" n="2" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete"><p part="N">And his son, Jesus Christ, whom we testify has always been, since before the
               beginning of this age, with the father in a spiritual way. He was begotten in an
               indescribable way before every beginning. Everything we can see, and everything
               beyond our sight, was made through him. He became a human being; and, having overcome
               death, was welcomed to the heavens to the Father. The Father gave him all power over
               every being, both heavenly and earthly and beneath the earth. Let every tongue
               confess that Jesus Christ, in whom we believe and whom we await to come back to us in
               the near future, is Lord and God. He is judge of the living and of the dead; he rewards every person
               according to their deeds. He has generously poured on us the Holy
                  Spirit, the gift and promise of
               immortality, who makes believers and those who listen to be children of God and
               co-heirs with Christ. This is the one we
               acknowledge and adore – one God in a trinity of the sacred name.</p></div>

               make you fully satisfied! He has an abundance everywhere.” With the help of God, this
               is actually what happened! A herd of pigs appeared in the way before our eyes! They
               killed many of them and there they remained for two nights, and were fully restored,
               and the dogs too were filled. Many of them had grown weak and left half-alive by the
               way. After this, they gave the greatest of thanks to God, and I was honoured in their
               eyes. From this day on, they had plenty of food. They also found some wild honey, and
               offered some of it to me. However, one of them said: “This honey must have been

               a great multitude and crowd will be taken for God. Also that there should be clerics
               to baptise and encourage a people in need and want. This is what the Lord says in the
               gospel: he warns and teaches in these words: “Go therefore and teach all nations,
               baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
               teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold I am with you all

                  condemned.”
               And yet again: “This gospel of the kingdom will be announced all over the world, as
               testimony to all the nations; and then will come the end.” In the same way, the Lord foretold this

               Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters
               will prophesy; your young people will see visions and your older people will dream
               dreams. Indeed, on my servants, men and women, I will pour out my Spirit and they
               will prophesy.” Hosea says: “Those who were not my people, I will call
               my people; and her who has not obtained mercy, I will name the one who has obtained
                  mercy. In the place where it was said: You are not my

               However, God is not influenced by such personal situations, and he chose me for this

               heart, my very gut feelings! He knows that it is enough that I desire very much, and
               am ready for this, that he would grant me to drink of his chalice, just as he was

               from limb by dogs or wild beasts, or were the birds of heaven to devour it. I declare
               with certainty that if this were to happen, I would have gained both my soul and my
               body. There is no doubt whatever that we will rise on the appointed day in the
               brightness of the sun, that is, in the glory of Christ Jesus our redeemer. We shall
               be like children of the living God and co-heirs of Christ and
               to be fashioned in his image, since it is from him and through him and in him that we

               Christ, who will never perish. Nor will they perish who do his will but they will
