                  a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. Thus,
                  a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to the name
                  'animal';</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they have a
                  common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">For should any one define in what sense each is an animal, his
                  definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally'
                  which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man
                  and an ox are both 'animal',</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">and these are univocally so named, inasmuch as not only the
                  name, but also the definition, is the same in both cases:</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal, the
                  statement in the one case would be identical with that in the other.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Things are said to be named 'derivatively', which derive their
                  name from some other name, but differ from it in termination. Thus the grammarian
                  derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the courageous man from the word
                  'courage'.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Of things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are
                  never present in a subject. Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual man, and is
                  never present in a subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts
                  are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said
                  subject. Some things, again, are present in a subject, but are never predicable of
                  a subject. For instance, a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in
                  the mind, but is not predicable of any subject; or again, a certain whiteness may
                  be present in the body (for colour requires a material basis), yet it is never
                  predicable of anything.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">Other things, again, are both predicable of a subject and
                  present in a subject. Thus while knowledge is present in the human mind, it is
                  predicable of grammar.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">There is, lastly, a class of things which are neither present in
                  a subject nor predicable of a subject, such as the individual man or the
                  individual horse.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">But, to speak more generally, that which is individual and has
                  the character of a unit is never predicable of a subject. Yet in some cases there
                  is nothing to prevent such being present in a subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in a
                  subject.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="2">Thus, 'man' is predicated of the individual man; but 'animal' is
                  predicated of 'man';</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">it will, therefore, be predicable of the individual man
                  also:</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Substance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of
                  the word, is that which is neither predicable of a subject nor present in a

                  within which, as species, the primary substances are included; also those which,
                  as genera, include the species.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For instance, the individual man is included in the species

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">It is plain from what has been said that both the name and the
                  definition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For instance, 'man' is predicted of the individual man. Now in
                  this case the name of the species man' is applied to the individual, for we use
                  the term 'man' in describing the individual;</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">and the definition of 'man' will also be predicated of the
                  individual man, for the individual man is both man and animal.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">Thus, both the name and the definition of the species are

               <div type="ic" n="1">With regard, on the other hand, to those things which are

               <div type="ic" n="2">Though, however, the definition is never predicable, there is
                  nothing in certain cases to prevent the name being used.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">For instance, 'white' being present in a body is predicated of
                  that in which it is present, for a body is called white: the definition, however,
                  of the colour white' is never predicable of the body.</div>

            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">This becomes evident by reference to particular instances which

               <div type="ic" n="3">Again, colour is present in body, therefore in individual

                  into a different state. Similarly that which was white becomes black, and that
                  which was bad good, by a process of change; and in the same way in all other cases
                  it is by changing that substances are capable of admitting contrary
                  qualities.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">But statements and opinions themselves remain unaltered in all

                  year, or something of that sort. In the same way, he would explain the size of a

                  nothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same moment. For though substance
                  is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet no one is at the same time both
                  sick and healthy, nothing is at the same time both white and black. Nor is there

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">As there is no existing word, our definition would perhaps be

                  interdependence if one of the two is denoted, not by that name which expresses the
                  correlative notion, but by one of irrelevant significance.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">The term 'slave,' if defined as related, not to a master, but to
                  a man, or a biped, or anything of that sort,</div>

            <div type="s" n="9">
               <div type="ic" n="1">Further, if one thing is said to be correlative with another,

                  found to have disappeared.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For suppose the correlative of 'the slave' should be said to be

               <div type="ic" n="1">For perception implies a body perceived and a body in which
                  perception takes place. Now if that which is perceptible is annihilated, it
                  follows that the body is annihilated, for the body is a perceptible thing; and if
                  the body does not exist, it follows that perception also ceases to exist. Thus the
                  annihilation of the perceptible involves that of perception.</div>

            <div type="s" n="9">
               <div type="ic" n="1">But the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the
                  perceptible.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that perception
                  also is annihilated, but perceptibles such as body, heat, sweetness, bitterness,
                  and so on, will remain.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Again, perception is generated at the same time as the
                  perceiving subject, for it comes into existence at the same time as the animal.
                  But the perceptible surely exists before perception; for fire and water and such
                  elements, out of which the animal is itself composed, exist before the animal is
                  an animal at all, and before perception. Thus it would seem that the perceptible

                  'double', he will also forthwith know definitely that of which it is the double.

                  not know at all that it is double.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">Again, if he knows that a thing is more beautiful, it follows
                  necessarily that he will forthwith definitely know that also than which it is more
                  beautiful. He will not merely know indefinitely that it is more beautiful than
                  something which is less beautiful,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">for this would be supposition, not knowledge.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="7">It is, therefore, evident that if a man apprehends some relative

               <div type="ic" n="1">By a disposition, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is

            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">Of a pair of contraries such that they have no intermediate, one

               <div type="ic" n="3">But those contraries which have an intermediate are not subject

               <div type="ic" n="4">It is not necessary that every substance, receptive of such
                  qualities, should be either black or white, cold or hot, for something
                  intermediate between these contraries may very well be present in the
                  subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">We proved, moreover, that those contraries have an intermediate
                  in the case of which the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the two
                  contraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it is a constitutive
                  property of fire to be hot, of snow to be white,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">it is necessary determinately that one of the two contraries,

                  advanced to the state when sight is natural is not said either to be blind or to
                  see. Thus 'positives' and 'privatives' do not belong to that class of contraries
                  which consists of those which have no intermediate.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">On the other hand, they do not belong either to that class which
                  consists of contraries which have an intermediate.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">For under certain conditions it is necessary that either the one

               <div type="ic" n="5">For when a thing has reached the stage when it is by nature
                  capable of sight, it will be said either to see or to be blind, and that in an
                  indeterminate sense, signifying that the capacity may be either present or absent;
                  for it is not necessary either that it should see or that it should be blind, but
                  that it should be either in the one state or in the other.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">Yet in the case of those contraries which have an intermediate
                  we found that it was never necessary that either the one or the other should be
                  present in every appropriate subject, but only that in certain subjects one of the

                  in the sense of the word 'opposite' which applies to possession and privation. Now
                  if Socrates exists, it is not necessary that one should be true and the other
                  false, for when he is not yet able to acquire the power of vision, both are false,
                  as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">But in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject
                  exists or not, one is always false and the other true.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For manifestly, if Socrates exists, one of the two propositions
                  'Socrates is ill', 'Socrates is not ill', is true, and the other false.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">This is likewise the case if he does not exist; for if he does
                  not exist, to say that he is ill is false, to say that he is not ill is
                  true.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">Thus it is in the case of those opposites only, which are
                  opposite in the sense in which the term is used with reference to affirmation and
                  negation, that the rule holds good, that one of the pair must be true and the

               <div type="ic" n="2">Primarily and most properly the term has reference to time: in
                  this sense the word is used to indicate that one thing is older or more ancient
                  than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more ancient' imply greater length
                  of time.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">Secondly, one thing is said to be 'prior' to another when the
                  sequence of their being cannot be reversed.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">In this sense 'one' is 'prior' to 'two'. For if 'two' exists, it
                  follows directly that 'one' must exist, but if 'one' exists, it does not follow
                  necessarily that 'two' exists: thus the sequence subsisting cannot be reversed. It
                  is agreed, then, that when the sequence of two things cannot be reversed, then
                  that one on which the other depends is called 'prior' to that other.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">In the third place, the term 'prior' is used with reference to
                  any order, as in the case of science and of oratory.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">For in sciences which use demonstration there is that which is
                  prior and that which is posterior in order; in geometry, the elements are prior to
                  the propositions; in reading and writing, the letters of the alphabet are prior to
                  the syllables. Similarly, in the case of speeches, the exordium is prior in order
                  to the narrative.</div>

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">Besides these senses of the word, there is a fourth. That which

               <div type="ic" n="2">In common parlance men speak of those whom they honour and love

                  the other, that which is in any way the cause may reasonably be said to be by
                  nature 'prior' to the effect.</div>

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">It is plain that there are instances of this.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">The fact of the being of a man carries with it the truth of the
                  proposition that he is, and the implication is reciprocal:</div>

                  true,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">and conversely, if the proposition wherein we allege that he is
                  true, then he is.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">The true proposition, however, is in no way the cause of the
                  being of the man, but the fact of the man's being does seem somehow to be the
                  cause of the truth of the proposition,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">for the truth or falsity of the proposition depends on the fact
