        <group type="textual_subject">
            <comment when="2019-08-30" who="kalvesmaki">Verbs in this group are meant to represent
                the kinds of verbs needed to express the claims found in the typical apparatus
                criticus of a critical edition. It is assumed that all statements in a criticus
                apparatus have a few common features. First, each statement is tethered to some
                locus in a base text. Second, each statement is about one or more textual witnesses,
                normally represented by a siglum or abbreviation; that is, the statements are about
                complete textual entities. Many times those entities are inert texts, but sometimes
                they are authors (an entry may assign a siglum to a person, e.g., Andronicus, and
                not a specific text). Third, each statement asserts whether the reading agrees with
                the base text at the locus in question or if it differs. The verbs in this group
                address these three common features. For the first, &lt;at-ref> is used, to restrict
                the scope of a claim to a particular passage. For the second, the grammatical
                subject is taken to be the textual entities referred to by the sigla (e.g.,
                manuscript S reads...). For the third feature, verb options should be limited in
                number. Verbal vocabulary should focus upon the common underlying sentiment, not on
                how it will be presented to the reader. The grammatical object of the claim of each
                of these verbs is taken to be a string representing the reading of the
                witness.</comment>
