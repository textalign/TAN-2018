            <comment when="2019-03-06" who="kalvesmaki">Items in this group are meant to represent
                the kinds of verbs needed to express the claims found in the typical apparatus
                criticus of a critical edition. It is assumed that all statements in a criticus
                apparatus have a few common features. First, each one is tethered to some locus in a
                base text. Second, each statement is about one or more textual witnesses, normally
                represented by a siglum or abbreviation. Third, each one asserts whether the reading
                agrees with the locus of the base text or if it differs. To the first point,
                &lt;locus> is introduced, to restrict the scope of a claim to a particular passage.
                To the second, the grammatical subject is taken to be the textual entities referred
                to by the sigla. To the third point, verbs should be limited in number. Human
                editors may legitimately express the same textual difference in various ways without
                alteration in meaning, and verbal vocabulary should focus upon the common underlying
                sentiment, not on how it will be presented to the reader. The reading of witnesses
                is taken to be the natural grammatical object of the claim.</comment>

                        is needed, @cert should be used, or a separate verb should be coined in a
